# Translation systems for low-resource Colombian Indigenous languages, a first step towards cultural preservation

This repository contains both the code and data necessary to replicate the results outlined in the article "Translation Systems for Low-Resource Colombian Indigenous Languages: A First Step Towards Cultural Preservation", presented at AmericasNLP 2024 on the creation of datasets for NLP applications. 

The scripts used for data acquisition, cleaning, and processing are located in the directory labeled "data processing." Train, Test, and Validation datasets for the four different laguages can be found in the folder "datasets/." Lastly, the  code for model training can be accessed within the directory titled "models/."

Due to the size of all models (100GB), access to them will be given upon reasonable request to the emails {jc.prietoa,mv.robles,rf.manrique} [at] uniandes.edu.co
